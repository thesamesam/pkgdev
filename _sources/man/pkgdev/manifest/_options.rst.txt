Positional Arguments
--------------------

:target:  
        Packages matching any of these restrictions will have their manifest
        entries updated. If no target is specified a path restriction is
        created based on the current working directory. In other words, if
        ``pkgdev manifest`` is run within an ebuild's directory, all the
        ebuilds within that directory will be manifested.

Optional Arguments
------------------

-f, --force    
               Force package manifest files to be rewritten. Note that this requires
               downloading all distfiles.

-m, --mirrors  
               Enable checking Gentoo mirrors first for distfiles. This is disabled by
               default because manifest generation is often performed when adding new
               ebuilds with distfiles that aren't on Gentoo mirrors yet.

Base Options
------------

-h, --help       
                 Show this help message and exit. To get more
                 information see the related man page.

--debug          
                 Enable debug checks and show verbose debug output.

-q, --quiet      
                 Suppress non-error, informational messages.

-v, --verbose    
                 Increase the verbosity of various output.

--color BOOLEAN  
                 Toggle colored output support. This can be used to forcibly
                 enable color support when piping output or other sitations
                 where stdout is not a tty.
